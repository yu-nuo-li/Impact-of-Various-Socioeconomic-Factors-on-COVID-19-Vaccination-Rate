# Exploring the Correlative Patterns Between COVID-19 Vaccination Rates and Socio-Economic Factors in the U.S.

## Project Overview

This project investigates how race-ethnicity distribution, poverty levels, and state Medicaid expansion status influence COVID-19 vaccination rates across the United States.
Using county- and state-level data, we explore the socio-economic determinants behind vaccination disparities and evaluate how public policy, especially Medicaid expansion, shapes vaccination outcomes. This project was part of the final project for DATASCI 406--Computation Methods.
